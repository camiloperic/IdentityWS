IdentityWS is part of the SIPLe project (Sooner I'll provide some documentation about this project).

SIPLe stands for Sistema de Iniciativa Popular Legislativa, in english it would be Legislative Popular Iniciative System. Legislative Popular Iniciative is a democratic tool granted in Brazilian Constitution, a form of political popular participation where anyone can write a propousal for a new law.

This project is based on Apache Axis 2.
